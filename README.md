LiftTech Analysis Project
Overview
This repository contains the codebase for the LiftTech Analysis Project, which focuses on detecting and analyzing weightlifting exercises using advanced machine learning techniques. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to predict exercise form and count repetitions accurately.

Directory Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

features/
This directory contains Python scripts for various feature engineering tasks essential for preparing the dataset for modeling.

__init__.py: Initializes the features module.
build_features.py: Contains functions for creating and compiling features from raw data.
count_repetitions.py: Functions for counting exercise repetitions based on processed data.
DataTransformation.py: Scripts for transforming the raw sensor data into a more usable format.
FrequencyAbstraction.py: Implements frequency domain feature extraction.
remove_outliers.py: Functions for identifying and removing outliers in the dataset.
TemporalAbstraction.py: Tools for extracting temporal features from time-series data.
models/
This directory contains scripts for training and evaluating machine learning models used in the project.

__init__.py: Initializes the models module.
LearningAlgorithms.py: Contains different machine learning algorithms used for model training.
predict_model.py: Script for making predictions with the trained models.
train.py: Main script to handle the training process of the models.
train_model.py: Additional utilities for model training.
confusion_matrix.png, confusion_matrices.png, confusion_matrix_decision_tree.png: Visual representations of model performance.
visualization/
This directory is intended for scripts and resources related to data visualization. (Details for this directory aren't provided, but it can be extended as needed.)
